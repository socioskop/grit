grit is an R-package build to handle registry data from Danish health care registries efficiently. Functions are provided that pulls data from relatively slow SQL connections and then builds a much faster binary database. Data splitting is build into data handling functions.

Another set of functions are encoders for data with huge amounts of nested/hierarchical coding systems, including ATC and ICD-08/-10 observations.

A third set of functions facilitate extraction of relevant features for machine-learning applications.
